Another Endless Runner in Unreal Engine 4, except actually endless this time

## Aspects of this project that will make me go back and study it
- Instantiates and deletes objects
- Contains Menu UI for starting and quitting game
- Polished Menu UI where cursor and game/UI transition is properly sorted
- Utilizes custom components and function libraries
- Has plenty of examples of inheritence
